# Android application ID

A unique id for your application using [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation). The application id for the Expo client app is `host.exp.exponent`, but it could also be `io.expo.client` or any other unique string that follows this notation. You don't need to own the domain to use the application id.
